      This specification defines a set of System Level APIs to allow Web applications retrieve the status of the device capabilities supported and system information from the underlying device.
    </section>
    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
        This document is intended to define the Device Capabilities API to retrieve the status of hardware device, get the value of selected properties, and subscribe to asynchronous notifications of some specific properties in Web applications. To avoid pushing an over-complicated and reduncdant API definitions, it firstly focuses on some general device capabilities, like CPU, memory, storage and display and so on. This specification is easy to be extended for supporting a new device capability during API evolution. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this specification doesn't attempt to re-define device APIs which are already officially published by W3C working group. For example, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/battery-status/">Battery Status API</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/netinfo-api/">Network Information API</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/screen-orientation/">Screen Orientation API</a>. If the published device API specification cannot satisfy the requirements, the right way is to consider how to extend it.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The purpose of Device Capabilities API is to provide a set of interfaces and methods for Web applications to retrieve the device status and system information from the underlying system. The supported capabilities provided by the device may be varied from smartphone to tablet, by use of this API, Web applications have the ability to know the exact status of the device on which they are running, and are allowed to take full advantage of the available device capabilities. For example, with the knowledge of the number of CPU cores installed on the devices, Web application can anticipate the optimal number of <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/">Web Worker</a> to be created for the computing-intensive tasks, and with the knowledge of the sensors supported on the devices, Web application can make use of these sensors to provide another choice of user interaction except for touching based user interaction.

      <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <p>
      A Web application using this API is granted to access some device specific data which may contain information that is treated as private by end-user. For instance a user may become sensitive to a Web application retrieve the available storage free space. Therefore, a conforming implementation of this specification MUST provide a mechanism that protects the user's privacy and this mechanism should ensure that no information exposed by this API is retrievable without the permission granted.

            <a>DeviceCapabilities</a> interface encapsulates a set of methods to retrieve the hardware capabilities and specific device data, e.g. CPU, storage and display, and event handler to register asynchronous notification when the interested system events are triggered. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The methods defined in <a>DeviceCapabilities</a>are designed to return a <dfn id="promise"><code><a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#promise">Promise</a></code></dfn> object and follow a specific pattern when invoked:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Make a request to the system to retrieve the specified information implied by the method name;
              </li>
              <li>
                Let <em><a href="#promise">promise</a></em> be a new <code><a href="#promise">Promise</a></code> object and <em>resolver</em> its associated resolver.
              </li>
              <li>
                Return <em><a href="#promise">promise</a></em> and run the remaining steps asynchronously.
              </li>
              <li>
                If an error occurs, run these substeps and then terminate these steps:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Let <em>error</em> be a new <code>DOMError</code> object whose name is <code>"UnknownError"</code>,
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Run <em>resolver</em>'s internal <em>reject</em> algorithm with <em>error</em> as <code>value</code>.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                If the operation successfully completes, run these substeps:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Let <em>data</em> be a new object for the specified device information (e.g. <a>DeviceCPU</a>, <a>DeviceStorage</a> and <a >DeviceDisplay</a>) that were retrieved, 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Run <em>resolver</em>'s intenal <code>fulfill</code> algorithm with <em>data</em> as <code>value</code>.
